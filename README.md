Project Description

Appam Economy is a satirical crypto/economy simulator where users upload photos of appams, and our AI “hole analyzer” maps every hole. Each hole becomes a tradable digital asset (A-Coin NFT) with a value. Think “Kerala tea shop meets Wall Street terminal.”

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

Kerala uncles have long argued about who makes the best appam — but there’s no financially liquid way to prove it in the global marketplace of holes. Meanwhile, crypto bros have been left without a hyper-volatile, culturally authentic, carb-based investment vehicle.

⸻

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We’ve built a platform where every appam photo is scanned for hole count, size, and symmetry. This data is minted as NFT-style assets, traded on a live, meme-powered hole market with a global “Hole Market Cap.” Users can HODL, flip rare 13-hole appams, or chase weekly “Most Symmetrical Hole” leaderboards.
